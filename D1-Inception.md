CS 386: Deliverable 1
Chore Tracker App, Group 1


Introduction:
Easily track chores and duties in one application. This is intended to be used by roommates or families and will give the user different permissions based on accessibility. Depending on permission, the users could have the ability to post chores, assign tasks, and give rewards for completed duties. The user also has the option to set recurring chores, time-sensitive chores, or person-specific chores. Rewards could be a point system. For example, 100 points will earn you ice cream or a small toy. Each chore could have different point amounts such as taking out the trash equals 50 points. There could also be an option to send messages or notifications to each other as a reminder to complete a certain task.

Initial  value  proposition  and  consumer  segments:
    Value Proposition:
Our Chore Tracking app makes life easier to manage. Instead of repeatedly asking your kids to do the same chores or begging your roommate to do the dishes, list what needs to be done on one platform that everyone can access. Everyone is always on their phone anyway, why not use it to encourage productivity in your home? 

Consumer Segments:
Parents of children
Kids living at home (all ages)
College students living in dorms
Adults/Young adults living with roommates
    
Interviews:

(Interview 1, by Olivia) Nicole Interview
1. I interviewed my roommate Nicole. It was just the two of us participating in the interview
2. I conducted the interview on the evening of February 10. 
3. Nicole would be a college-age user of our chore-tracking app. She falls into segment 3 (above) as a young adult living with roommates. She lived with a roommate last year and lives with two people this year. She intends to have roommates for at least the next two years so she will continue to be a possible consumer. Nicole would likely be a normal user of the app, not a “privileged” user. 
4. Nicole did show a need for a chore tracker app. However, she didn’t really have a need or even a want for a lot of the features. She doesn’t feel like she needs to assign her roommates chores to do because as college students, life gets busy unexpectedly. She really doesn’t care who does what chores as long as they get done and everyone pitches in somehow. Also, she doesn’t want the app itself to become a chore. Nicole said she would like to track chores, but hasn’t on her own because it really just sounds like extra work. Really she just wants something to make sure that not too much time goes by without cleaning floors. She says it’s easy to do chores, but also easy to forget the last time you did them. It would be great to have something to remind her that it has been two weeks since she cleaned her bathroom.
5. “I’m friends with all my roommates so it feels weird assigning chores. Like that’s what my mom did. We are all just here to help out I don’t think we need to assign anything.” -Nicole 
 “Sometimes I just forget when the stove was cleaned last. Or I know when I did it but maybe someone has done it since then? I don’t want to clean something if it was just cleaned.” -Nicole
6. I thought college kids would be very interested in the chore tracker app because coordinating with roommates can be tricky sometimes. Nicole’s interview showed me that this hypothesis might be incorrect. In addition, college kids are very busy. Nicole confirmed this and really stressed to me the importance of a simple tracking service that would make her life easier without extra work.   
7. Based on Nicole’s interview, our product would be nice for her to have. However, if it is too complicated, too difficult to use or has an excessive number of extra features, she would probably quit using it after a couple of weeks.



(Interview 2, by Olivia) Alicia Interview

1. I interviewed my younger sister, Alicia. It was just the two of us participating in the interview over Skype.
2. The interview was conducted on February 12th.
3. Alicia is a high school senior who will be a college freshman living in a traditional dorm next year. She is in the consumer segment of college students living in dorms with at least one roommate. She will be sharing a room with one other person and this is the first time she will have a roommate. 
4. Alicia is new to living with a roommate and new to living on her own. She is not sure what the best way to communicate about chores and responsibilities is and is excited about being able to use an app to do so. She is especially concerned with keeping the chore-load equal between both her and her roommate. She wants to be able to have a set list of chores that needs to get done on a regular basis. She wants her and her roommate to have access to the list and be able to cross them off together. Instead of assigning each other chores, she would rather have each of them assign themselves the number of chores that they think they have time for each week. She knows that some weeks are busier than others and she may have extra time to vacuum floors when her roommate is busy. She also noted that a useful feature would be a point-system of sorts that keeps track of chores completed. While these points may not amount to anything, it would make it more obvious if one person was taking the majority load of chores. She wants to be able to distinguish between “easy” and “hard” chores. For example, vacuuming probably takes more time than taking out the trash. Therefore, these should not be tracked as equal chores because the person vacuuming every week is working more time than the person taking out the trash each week. She also noted that a cool feature she would use is a reminder system than she could use to automatically send her roommate a notification to do a certain chore. 
5. “I want to create a to-do list and then be able to share it with my roommate, like Google Docs does. Then we can work on the same list at the same time and see what the other person has done.” -Alicia
6. “I’m a really organized person but I don’t want to use the app if it’s going to look boring and make me feel overwhelmed with chores.” -Alicia
7. “Can there be like a button that says “Remind-Roommate Name” that when I press it sends them a message about a chore. Like the chore “Vacuum” could have a button and I press it and my roomie gets a notification that’s like ‘Alicia just wants to remind you to vacuum this week! Have a good day.’ The ‘have a good day’ part is so I don’t sound pushy. That would be really nice and cool.” -Alicia
8. As a future college freshman who has never had a roommate before Alicia really liked the idea of having an app to organize and facilitate communication about chores. I hypothesized that she would be very interested since she doesn’t have any prior experience so is very open to anything that can help. I am not surprised that she wants this product, but I am concerned that the app may be used for only a week or two before roommates lose interest. 
9. Based on Alicia’s interview our product is somewhere between nice to have and must have. Alicia said that it might start out as a “must-have” but as life becomes busy and her and her roommate get into more of a routine, it may become more of a “nice to have.”

1. I interviewed Grace Yang. Grace is an NAU student who lives off campus with two other roommates off campus. 
2. The interview took place on Wednesday, February 12th. 
3. Grace is a college age student who fits one of our customer demographics well. We are targeting people who would have chores and responsibilities to keep track of, as well as people with roommates to delegate roles to.
Grace was really interested in the application. She had a few modifications that should would like to see added before she bought the product, but overall she was interested in purchasing the app. She stated that we should format the calendar to accept user-defined time increments, such as a half hour blocks to schedule events/chores. Grace wanted a way to have someone keep her accountable as she is trying to form healthy habits. Some main takeaways are that the app woul d be ideal for self-motivation and healthy reminders to stick to desired goals/habits. This also applies to sleep cycles and biological processes. 
Grace would also be interested in the app if there was a fun way to keep accountable. One of her favorite apps plants a virtual tree that will only grow if you stay on your task and do not stop studying before your set time expires. 

Another desirable extension is the ability to parse syllabi/schedules and put them into an interactive interface. This would be difficult to format without reading pdf tables, but we can see. Also to have professor’s info extracted for easy use in the app.

In regards to penalty for not completing tasks:


“I want a small penalty, just enough to say aww shoot!”


Why do you use/like an agenda?

“Want to have that feeling that I am controlling my life”

            the “time intervals are specific. Instead of just morning, evening, 
night, etc”. “Breaks the day down into manageable chunks. 

“Beauty is really a thing I would like to keep organized”. 

“Form more habits as you progress. But don’t limit, but suggest.”

6.It was confirmed that there is value to the app. One of our main target clients is indeed college students, who have much homework and personal duties to track and manage. Some hypotheses, such as the value of having multiple roommates sign up, were shot down by this interview. Grace stated that she and her roommates are quite good at communicating and staying on schedule with group chores. However, Grace recommended that I interview her friend Claire, who lives in the Suites and has a need for a scheduling system to help her fairly divide/assign duties with her roommate.

   7.Another objection I ran into was the fact that some people are naturally better at remembering their menial chores than others. Grace stated that she does not need a reminder for many cleaning duties, but would benefit from positive reinforcement to feel better doing them.


In its current state, Grace says that our app would be nice to have, but not a necessity. If we managed to get syllabus parsing and instructor info added (maybe integrated with bblearn?) she would certainly purchase the app. Rating: 7/10.

(Interview 2, Joe Vargovich)
Link to interview transcript: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wj9UctJnSb7XaWfCDiwq40A3ia6BUZs99dXlrEOK4YQ/edit?usp=sharing

1.I interviewed Claire, who is a college student who lives in the Suites and shares her room with one other person. 
2.The interview took place on Thursday, February 15th. 
3.Claire is a college student who fits into our customer demographic. There is a possible need to keep track of assignments and household duties.
4.Claire was overall not very interested in the chore tracking aspect of our project. She simply stated that she doesn’t use planners often, and relies on her memory to complete tasks in a timely manner. For household duties, she simply sticks to posted schedules that she and her roommate reference to track their turn to clean. She has had conflicts with her roommate in the past, but she doesn't think she would use our app to help track and resolve cleaning duties. 

“I am not very orderly, so I do not like to have a defined schedule.”
“I never use an agenda, I just remember things.

6.A key insight from this interview is the fact that some students are simply not committed to using a schedule/agenda. The app should be focused toward students who already use defined plans in order to show them that the app is superior and faster than an agenda. If we want to target less orderly students, the convenience would need to be strongly demonstrated in advertising.
7.Overall, Claire thought that there were some interesting features presented in the app, but she would be unlikely to use it. Rating: 2/10. 


Zachary Spielberger - 2 Interviews

https://drive.google.com/open?id=1AKg8tcmhfd-MCq_PQN_MWNGK4k-xmZBvHdQZQn2InrE

Interview 1:
1. I interviewed my girlfriend Sedona who lives with her family consisting of 3 other people in Phoenix.
2. The interview took place on Wednesday February 12th over the phone.
3. Sedona is currently a college student who lives with her family which fits into our target audience .
4. Sedona liked the idea of this application and provided some suggestions that would help make it better overall. She uses Google Calendar frequently, so being able to sync the in app calendar with Google would be useful and help her be more organized with chores. Another aspect she would like added to the calendar is the option to switch between each member of the family in order to see each member’s tasks more clearly. She also suggested giving the users the ability to add widgets to the homescreen so they can quickly view chores needed to be done, or view their calendar without having to open the app. She also would like to have the ability to communicate to each member of her family directly through the app without having to go to another app to send a message. This could also include sending out alerts to the family or individual members as a way of reminding them. 
5. “The app is telling them to do something rather than me appearing naggy or annoying”
”Be able to send reminders to family to do something. “I will be home in 30 minutes and then we have to go to the store” and alert would be sent to entire family”
6. As a college student living with her family who normally does not designate chores and members often do not contribute, Sedona would be interested in using it with her family. This would help share the chores more evenly between her family.  I hypothesise that this app will prove to be useful to families like hers to ensure everyone is doing an equal amount of work around their house. 
7. Sedona says that this app would be nice to have as it would help her and her family.

Interview 2:
1.I interviewed my sister Rachel who is currently a freshman at NAU living in a dorm with one roommate.
2.The interview took place on Thursday February 13th over the phone.
3.Rachel is currently a college student who shares a room with another person, so she fits into our target audience. 
4.Rachel liked the idea of this application and thought it would be a helpful reminder for her and her roommate to do chores in their dorm.  She currently delegates chores based on who likes doing certain things or her and her roommate see something that needs to be done. Currently, there is no system in place so each person does the same amount of work around the apartment. 
5.“Another thing that I like the idea of is the option to have notifications or messages to remind people to do their chores as often people forget what they are supposed to do.”
“This app would also help me as I can use it to delegate chores and duties for my roommate and I in our dorm room.”
6.As a freshman in a dorm, this app would be useful to her and her roommate as many chores are just done as they see something that needs to be done. I  hypothesize that this will be helpful to many college students living in dorms to help delete chores more equally than they currently do. 
7.Rachel would consider this app nice to have currently. 

Leslie Gurrola - 2 Interviews (1 pending)
Interview 1:
1.Chelsea Charley, 19 lives in a suite with 3 other people and shares rooms with another person, she lives at NAU. 
2.This interview took place on Wednesday, February 12, face to face.
3.Chelsea is a college student who fits into our target audience for this app. She has a roommate and they try to distribute their chores half and half. 
4.Chelsea had her fair share of apps similar to the one we are currently working on and she is very interested in trying it. She is a person that likes to be organized and does not like to out-right ask her roommate to do a certain chore. She stated that the idea of having her and her roommate in a group so they can both communicate with each other by assigning chores will be quick and convenient due to the fact that she has a busy schedule. She pointed out that she likes the calendar views but the fact that there should be a list page where you can just see the list of chores you have can also be something that we can implement. She likes the design and she is someone that likes to customize her calendar. She would like to have some color coordination on it and have a part where if supply were running low then she has it shown to her, so like a shopping list. Also she would like notifications and alerts just to remind her. 
5.“It would be nice to have a list setting so I can just see the things i need to do not necessarily just see in on the calendar”.
“It would be cool to have a list of when supplies are running low so i would know when i need to go to the store, so like a shopping list i guess, so if me and my roommate see if and she happens to be at the store she can also get it.” 
“I like the idea that it can recommend you to do something so it can notify you if my roommate did this task for the past week i should do it instead this week so there is a better distribution of chores.”
6.Chelsea is interested in this app and would even recommend it to her family. She is a part of our main target and her stating that she would recommend it to her family even better. I hypothesized that if our app was out in the market she would be someone that would've likely have downloaded it since she has an interest in these types of apps. She was concerned that her roommate not might not want to have the app since they already have a routine of the chores they do themselves. 
7.Chelsea says she would download the app but only due to the fact that she tries the app constantly, she doesn't really know if she would use the app constantly if she was the only person to use it. 

Interview 2: 
Sylvia, 20 years old, lives with her parents. 
1.The interview was Tuesday February 11. 
2.Sylvia is a college student who lives with her family, mainly with her parents. She is part of our demographic since she is a college student and lives with her family. She does get assigned chores and tasks from her parents. 
3.Syvlia was not interested in our app. She states that she and her parents have a mutual understanding about chores that have to be done. She is stuck with most of the chores since she is an only child and her parents are constantly working. She has been doing chores from a young age so she doesn't really need to be reminded. She states that the fact that she herself is already organized then she doesn't really need any reminding apps she does it herself.  One take away from this interview is that if our app is simply like another calendar/ organizing app then we have a greater competition since there are people out there already having their own way of organizing. 
5.“ As I mentioned my parents and I have a mutual understanding on how things are supposed to be done around our home”. 
“I would not be interested in an app to help me organize my chores since they are already organized”
“Being the only child I am stuck with the majority of the chores, since both my parents work, i take care of keeping our house clean”.
“ I’ve been doing chores from a very young age, it sort of has become a part of my life. For example, if i don’t sweep at least twice a week, i feel that my set routine has been messed with. So i guess i don't really have a way to remember them, like i don't write them down, i just do them”. 
6.It was shown in this interview that not everyone in our target audience is needing the app. Sylvia can be an example that people do not necessarily need this app and to appeal to people like her we would need to step up our game so we are different from other apps.  I hypothesis that people who already have a set routine like a family would be less likely to purchase this app than people who just met each other and do not have a routine with each other. 
7.As of right now Sylvia would not be a customer for our app. 

Zachary Wilson-Long - 1 Interview:
1.Landon, 19 years old, lives with 3 roomates, all male students around same age.
2.The interview was conducted on Wednesday February 12.
3.Landon is a college student who shares a living room and kitchen with his 3 roomates who seem to be having problems dividing chores up between them so he fits into our target audience.
4.Landon was interested in the app but he was initially on the fence because he did not like the idea of “being assigned chores” as that seemed immature for their age. However he did feel like some chores were not getting done in a timely manner and that people would ask others to clean messes that they did not make. He was also initially on the fence about the app because he thought it might “increase tension”.
5.He wanted a way to track contribution to the mess made and a way to track how hard/long a task took to complete so someone could not just pick the easy chores and get out of doing most of the work. Also he feels like he doesn’t cook very much but is always asked to help do dishes. He thought just a method to see whos done what would be helpful for resolving these disputes.
6.Landon brought up how he has also had problems with his roomates significant other producing towards messes and not contributing to any cleanup and if that could be recorded or documented that it would be helpful.
7.Overall Landon did seemed to be interested in the app which we hypothesized but no as much as we would have liked so we should probably tailor to some of the things he and other interviewees were most excited about in the app.

Interview 1- by Andrew Munoz 
1.Tatiyana, Age 19, College Sophomore with 2 other roomates 
2.Conducted February 9th 2020
3.Tatiyana is a college student who struggles with having a clean apartment due to not having a way to organize their chores. Chores are often left undone and get left to be done all in one day. This makes her a good target for our app.
4. Key insights: Being able to organize and assign tasks will allow for users to get chores around the house done faster. Tatiyana felt as if we are similar to a calendar app in the way that our app can be used as a way to set tasks along with reminders. Tatiyana overall gave the app a 6 on a scale of 1 to 10 on the usefulness category which means she saw the potential in it but is not currently wowed by the app.
5.“I already use a calendar app to take down notes and events so it’s similar “
“Yeah, a lot of the time we end up forgetting to do our chores and have to do them all at once like on a weekend or something “
“It would probably help keep us organized and help us have the house clean more often”
6.In conclusion Tatiyana helped us confirm that we a lot of households and students find it hard to organize their chores in a way that will have everyone equally responsible. She confirmed that there is a need for our app and that we can end up helping households become more organized
7.From Tatiyana’s interview this app would fit into the nice to have category.

Final  value  proposition  and  consumer  segments:

Value Proposition :
    
    The house is clean, the dishes are done, and nobody is arguing; all thanks to the Chore Tracker App. Everyone is always on their phone anyway, why not use it to encourage productivity in your home?
    

Consumer segments:

Parents of children
Kids living at home (all ages)
College students living in dorms
Adults/Young adults living with roommates
Singles living alone (keep track of personal lives)
